# Rails Girls Berlin App Tutorial

Today, we’ll build your very first app together.
Doing that, you will learn the basics of Ruby on Rails. We’ve prepared it a bit, so you can really focus on understanding what you’re doing.

## What's the app about?
We will build a small application to store and manage ideas. The app is very basic so you can easily adapt it to your own ideas.

Have fun coding and don't forget to ask your coaches when something is unclear ;-)
